 * business has no sub-categories set up (the common case), every category is
 * just a flat top-level link - no dropdown renders.
 *
 * Empty categories (no Active products) are dropped entirely - a nav link
 * that leads to an empty shop page is a dead end, not a feature. `limit`
 * caps how many top-level links come back (a nav-bar-width concern, not a
 * data one, hence a display option here rather than baked into the API).
